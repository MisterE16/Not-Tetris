# Not-Tetris Documentation

## Reasoning
The custom P or d piece has a unique shape that uses a mix of the O, J, and I pieces. It has a compact base like the O, and includes an arm similar to J and L. This piece is unique because the rotation can offer strategic options for filling in gaps or setting up combinations. Depending on the state of the game, this piece can change the direction of possibilities on the board, whereas the original orientation may be useful for gaps or small adjustments, and the d orientation may allow for a more flexible approach to clearing lines or setting up future placements. 

## Custom Gameplay
The gameplay provides us the potential of the P piece by showing how well it fits with the board and what types of sequences can occur with the piece. It has the ability to get over 1600 points within one minute of gameplay by itself, and depending how you choose to place it can determine how many lines you can clear (4 lines max). The gameplay also shows how useful it could be in the original game mode. This can include being able to clear multiple lines, setting up combinations, and even changing the state of the board for future placements. 

## Difficulties
Most issues encountered were very minor and included setting up the timer for the most part. At first, the text wasn't displaying properly for how much time has gone by and I had to use a different method compared to the score text. I was able to convert the game time to a string and then the time displayed correctly.
